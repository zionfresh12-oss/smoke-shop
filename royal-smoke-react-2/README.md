# Royal Smoke React (Vite)

This zip includes a minimal, working Vite + React setup that fixes the **Missing script: dev** and 502 issues.

## Run in CodeSandbox or locally

```bash
npm i
npm run dev   # exposes port 5173
```

If CodeSandbox asks, expose port **5173**. The app binds to `--host` so the preview works.
